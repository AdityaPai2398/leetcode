# loop through leetcode one more time, ; )

### questions to ask
* Array
	* Is array sorted
	* Given two arrays, which one's size is bigger

### Graph related errors
* detect cycle in undirected graph
    - pass in super node inside dfs recursive call

### boundary case
* passed in a reference variable, check null pointer case
* grid-based problem
	- gridsize == 1, no solution inside grid

### smells for refactoring and optimization
* code length > 100
* too many if statement checking for boundary cases
