/*
All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". 
When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

For example,

Given s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT",

Return: ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"].


要升序打印所有不同的长度为10的序列)
还要写dfs, 带间距输出
follow up 重复元素要允许存在
